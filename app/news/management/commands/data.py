        "body": "Get in the boats and go.” As the coronavirus pandemic upended global commerce in March 2020, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell repeatedly invoked the urgent British evacuations from Dunkirk in World War II.\r\n\r\nThis wasn’t the time, he said, to get hung up on the technicalities that central bank economists and lawyers love to chew over. Mr. Powell bluntly directed his colleagues to move as fast as possible. They devised unparalleled emergency-lending backstops to stem an incipient financial panic that threatened to exacerbate the unfolding economic and public-health emergencies.\r\n\r\nOver the week of March 16, markets experienced an enormous shock to what investors refer to as liquidity, a catchall term for the cost of quickly converting an asset into cash.",

        "body": "OTTAWA—Canada’s legislature on Monday approved extending the use of the special emergency powers invoked last week by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to quell protests against Covid-19 mandates, which had paralyzed the capital and disrupted cross-border trade.\r\n\r\nA motion seeking approval of a cabinet order that invoked powers available under the country’s Emergencies Act for a full 30-day period passed Canada’s lower house of parliament by a 185-151 vote. Mr. Trudeau, who leads a minority Liberal government, received support from the country’s left-leaning New Democratic Party to extend the emergency powers. The Conservative Party and Bloc Quebecois opposed, arguing that the invocation of emergency powers threatened civil liberties.",
